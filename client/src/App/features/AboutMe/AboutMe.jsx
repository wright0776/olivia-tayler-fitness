                    I have been working with children who have special needs since 2012 as a Behavior Technician. I discovered my love for yoga and couldn’t get enough of the practice that was transforming my life. Wanting to explore and deepen my knowlege, I completed my 200 hour Power Yoga training. I have been teaching since 2017. I discovered Kids Yoga this year and it was an instant fit, bridging my two passions.
